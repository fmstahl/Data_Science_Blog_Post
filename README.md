## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code runs with Python version 3.* and requires only libraries included in the Anaconda distribution for python.

You will need to download Stackoverflowâ€™s 2020 Annual Developer Survey and put it in a specific folder. You can find the data to download [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). </br>



## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:</br>
1. How is the salary of developers distributed in Europe compared to North America? </br>
2. Is there a similiar correlation between selected factors and the salary in Europe and in North America? </br>
3. Is there a notable difference in job satisfaction between Europe and North America? </br>


## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://fmstahl.medium.com/how-does-the-old-world-compare-to-the-new-world-spoken-from-a-software-developers-perspective-ad08489704c2)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
I must give credit to Stackoverflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Stackoverflow link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
